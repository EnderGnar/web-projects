    <h1>Rubik's Cube</h1>
    <p>There is no functionality to scramble it so you have to do that by hand. Just drag the face you want to rotate. If you want to rotate the whole cube drag outside of it.</p>
    <p>If you rotate the centers the win detection might not trigger as I did not know back then, that they can actually be rotated in a valid solution.</p>
