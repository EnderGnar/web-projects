	<h1>Welcome to 3d Planets</h1>
	<p>This project was built as a prototype of how we could use our own 3d engine to do more than just Rubiks cube animations.</p>
	<p>At that time we did not have a clear idea on how to effectively create perspective, which is why the field of view is very limited.</p>
	<p>Navigate using WASD to move in the XY plane and Space and Shift to move up or down. Dragging the mouse turns the camera.</p>
	<p>Use N to turn all planets into circles.</p>
	<button onclick="document.getElementById('outterprev').hidden = true">Hide</button>
